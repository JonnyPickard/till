Till
====

1. As a user,
   So that I can see an items cost,
   I would like to be able to input the item into the till.

2. As a user,
   So that I can see the total cost,
   I would like the till to output a receipt.

3. As a user,
   So that I can see the total tax,
   I would like the till to output a tax amount.
