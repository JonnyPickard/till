Till
====

1. As a user,
   So that I can see an items cost,
   I would like to be able to input the item into the till.

2. As a user,
   So that I can see the total cost,
   I would like the till to output a receipt.

3. As a user,
   So that I can see the total tax,
   I would like the till to output a tax amount.

4. As the owner,
   So that I can change the menu,
   I would like to be able to add items to the list.

Ideas
=====

1. Separate project with up + minify using grunt.

2. Add items to list.
